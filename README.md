# ML Kit Translate 

This app demonstrates how to build an end-to-end user experience with [Google ML Kit APIs](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit) and following the new [Material for ML design guidelines](https://material.io/collections/machine-learning/).

The goal is to make it as easy as possible to integrate ML Kit into your app with an experience that has been user tested:

* Real-time translate using the on-device Text Recognition, Language ID, Translate APIs - an end-to-end solution from text recognition to translate in live camera.

## How to use the app

This app demonstrates live text translate using the camera:
* Open the app and point the bounding box of the camera at a text of interest. The recognized text and it's detected language will show up on the top part of the bottom sheet.
* As you keep the camera stable to recognize a text, you'll see the translated version of this text on the bottom in real-time using the on-device Translate API.
* You can also switch the translate language using the drop down menu.
